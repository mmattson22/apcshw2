/*
BASE CASE: hit a wall
           get to the end

Don't move to the right--recursively call to go to the right
Solve(x,y) -- Solve(x+1,y)

Solve(x,y) {
           Done if B[x][y] = exit
           Return to previous strp if B[x][y] = wall
           Otherwise: Solve(x+1,y)
                      Solve(x-1,y)
                      Solve(x,y+1)
                      Solve(x,y-1)
}

Path-finding
Search
Blind search: have no info about the maze
Depth first search: go as deep down one path as you can before going back
State space search- state: state of existence in the world
                  : search where you attempt to get to another state until you 
		    reach the end
Implicit data structure: nodes not created in the program; nodes created/lost so
                         that a graph exists over the course of the program
Explicit data structure: maze program; maze created by us, explicitly

System.out.printf()--prints everything on the same line
                   --can set placeholder with %s (string), %d (int), %f (float/double)
		   System.out.printf("Hello %s earth", "middle");
		        --prints "Hello middle earth"
		   --%n_s/d/f -- leaves n number of spaces for each string, int, float
